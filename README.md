# Python SWT Library

Python library for handling `Simple Web Tokens`.

## Documentation

You can find the docs [here](https://python-swt.readthedocs.io/).

## Caveats

- Please use `pycryptodome` and not `pycrypto` as the later is unmaintained and
  broken on python 3.8+
- Currently only supports RSA-SHA256

## TODO

- Add support HMAC SHA256
